This chapter presents existing literature that is relevant
to the research problems tackled in this
thesis. Section~\ref{sec:expl-model-free} outlines past work in
model-free reinforcement learning that introduced different
exploration techniques. Prior works on real-time heuristic search
methods, that are extensively used 
in this thesis, are presented in
Section~\ref{sec:real-time-heuristic}. Local function approximation
techniques have been very successful in robotics and some example
works are introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:local-funct-appr}. Section~\ref{sec:model-based-reinf}
outlines existing literature on model-based reinforcement learning
methods which combine learning dynamical models online with model-based
planning using the learned models.
Very recent works that have proposed approaches integrating
model-free learning with model-based planning are highlighted in
Section~\ref{sec:integr-model-free}. Finally,
Section~\ref{sec:using-inacc-models} presents prior work in
reinforcement learning and planning communities that utilize
inaccurate models to reduce the amount of real-world experience
required to compute a successful plan or an optimal policy. In all
these domains, the amount of literature is immense so the focus in
this chapter is on relevance to this thesis rather than an exhaustive list.

\section{Exploration in Model-Free RL}
\label{sec:expl-model-free}

% Mention greedy approaches - estimate model and then exploit it fully
% Why exploration is really needed
% Mention that in model-based learning, we can do more intelligent
% exploration such as E3 and RMAX
% But in model-free, broadly two categories
