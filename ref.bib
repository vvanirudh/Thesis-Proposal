Our model shows strong connection with the classicKalman Filtermodel, with the kernel feature space as hidden state space. KernelDynamicalModeling is tested against two benchmark time series and achieves high quality predictions.},

We construct the theoretical underpin- ning and derive a concrete algorithm for nonlinear identification. The obtained algorithm needs no iterative optimization procedure and can be implemented on the basis of fast and reliable numerical schemes. The simulation result shows that our algorithm can express dynamics with a high degree of accuracy. 1},

abstract = {This article presents a new approach of soft material modeling for robotic manipulation which combines physical modeling and tracking of a deformable object. We discuss the construction of geometrical models using MRI system and how to overcome the problem of variability. The physical model focuses on meat/muscles deformation. We introduce the principal criteria for choosing most appropriate models and discuss two modeling methods which suit our problem: mass spring model and tensor mass model. The introduction of anisotropy in these models allows results to be more realistic but evolves an increasing of computing time.}

abstract = {This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word "reinforcement." The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},
